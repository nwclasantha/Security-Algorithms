the first sixty characters is the solution 

i thank the acm for this award
i can't help but feel that i am receiving this honor for timing and serendipity as much as technical merit 
unix swept into popularity with an industry wide change from central mainframes to autonomous minis
i suspect that daniel bobrow would be here instead of me if he could not afford a pdp and and had to settle for a pdp
moreover the current state of unix is the result of a large number of people

there is an old age
dance with the one that brought you which means that i should talk about unix
i have not worked on maintream unix in many years yet i continue to get undeserved credit for the work of others
therefore i am not going to talk about unix but i want to thank everyone who has contributed 

that brings me to dennis ritchie
our collaboration has been a thing of beauty
in the ten years that we have worked together i can recall only one case of miscoordination of work 
on that occasion i discovered that we both had written the same line assembly language program
i compared the sources and was astounded to find that they matched character for character
the result of our work together as been far greater than the work that we each contributed


in college before videogames we would amuse our selves by posing programming exercises
one og the favorites was to write the shortest self reproducing program
since this is an exercise divorced from reality the usual vehicle was fortran
actually fortran was the language of choice for the same reason that three legged races are popular

more precisely stated the problem is to write a source program that when compiled and executed will produce as output an exact copy of its source
if you have never done this i urge you to try it on your own
the discovery of how to do it is a revelation that far surpasess any benefit obtained by being told how to do it
the part about shortest was iust an incentive to demonstrate skill and determine a winner

figure shows a self reproducing program in the c programming language
the purist will note that the program is not precisely a self reproducing program but will produce a self reproducing program
this entry is much too large to win a prize but it demonstrates the technique and has two important properties that i need to complete my story
this program can be easily written by another program
this program can contain an arbitrary amount of excess baggage that will be reproduced along with the main algorithm
in the example even the comment is reproduced
